## Installation

### Manual Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/1999AZZAR/terminal-mcp-server.git
cd terminal-mcp-server

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build
```

## Usage

### Starting the Server

#### Standard Mode
```bash
# Start the server using stdio (default mode)
npm start

# Or run the built file directly
node build/index.js
```

#### Clean Environment Mode (Recommended)
If you experience shell configuration errors like:
```
--: eval: line 8551: syntax error near unexpected token `('
--: eval: line 8551: `back () '
--: line 1: dump_bash_state: command not found
```

Use the clean environment runner to bypass problematic shell configurations:

```bash
# Use the clean runner script
./run-clean.sh

# Or use npm script
npm run start:clean

# Or manually with clean bash
bash --noprofile --norc -c "node build/index.js"
```

The clean environment mode uses `bash --noprofile --norc` to avoid loading `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`, and other shell configuration files that might contain malformed functions or aliases.

### Server Configuration

The server runs in stdio mode by default, which is perfect for direct integration with MCP clients. You can enable debug logging by setting the `DEBUG` environment variable:

```bash
# Run with debug logging
DEBUG=true node build/index.js

# Or set it as an environment variable
export DEBUG=true
node build/index.js
```

### Testing with MCP Inspector

```bash
# Start the MCP Inspector tool
npm run inspector
```

### Available NPM Scripts

```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# Start the server (standard mode)
npm start

# Start the server in clean environment (recommended)
npm run start:clean

# Start with file watching for development
npm run watch

# Run the MCP Inspector for testing
npm run inspector

# Run tests
npm test
```

## Best Practices

### Command Execution

- Before running commands, it's best to determine the system type (Mac, Linux, etc.)
- Use full paths to avoid path-related issues
- For command sequences that need to maintain environment, use `&&` to connect multiple commands
- For long-running commands, use the `timeout` parameter to set appropriate limits
- Check exit codes in the response to verify command success

### SSH Connection

- Ensure SSH key-based authentication is set up
- If connection fails, check if the key file exists (default path: `~/.ssh/id_rsa`)
- Make sure the SSH service is running on the remote host
- The server automatically retries failed connections with exponential backoff
- Connection health is monitored and sessions are automatically reconnected when needed

### Session Management

- Use the session parameter to maintain environment and working directory between related commands
- For operations requiring specific environments, use the same session name
- Working directories persist across commands in the same session
- Environment variables set in one command persist for subsequent commands in the same session
- Sessions automatically close after 20 minutes of inactivity

### Error Handling

- Command execution results include structured output with command, working directory, exit code, stdout, and stderr
- Check the exit code to determine if the command executed successfully (0 = success, non-zero = error)
- The server provides detailed error messages for connection issues, timeouts, and validation errors
- For complex operations, add verification steps to ensure success
- Use appropriate timeout values for long-running commands

### Working Directory Management

- Use the `workingDirectory` parameter to execute commands in specific directories
- Working directories are remembered across commands in the same session
- Paths are automatically validated and errors are reported clearly

### Timeout Management

- Set appropriate timeout values based on your command's expected duration
- Default timeout is 30 seconds, configurable from 1 to 300 seconds
- Commands that exceed the timeout will return exit code 124
- Use longer timeouts for operations like package installation or compilation

## Output Format

The `execute_command` tool returns structured output in the following format:

```
Command: <command that was executed>
Working Directory: <working directory if specified>
Exit Code: <exit code of the command>

STDOUT:
<standard output of the command>

STDERR:
<standard error output of the command, if any>
```

### Exit Codes

- **0**: Command executed successfully
- **Non-zero**: Command failed or encountered an error
- **124**: Command timed out (when using timeout parameter)

## Troubleshooting

### Shell Configuration Errors

If you encounter errors like:
```
--: eval: line 8551: syntax error near unexpected token `('
--: eval: line 8551: `back () '
--: line 1: dump_bash_state: command not found
```

These errors are caused by problematic shell configurations (oh-my-bash, alias-hub, or custom functions). Use the clean environment mode:

```bash
# Recommended solution
./run-clean.sh

# Alternative solutions
npm run start:clean
bash --noprofile --norc -c "node build/index.js"
```

### SSH Connection Issues

For SSH connection problems:

1. **Check SSH key permissions**:
   ```bash
   chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
   chmod 644 ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
   ```

2. **Test SSH connection manually**:
   ```bash
   ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa username@hostname
   ```

3. **Enable debug logging**:
   ```bash
   DEBUG=true npm run start:clean
   ```

### Environment Variable Issues

If environment variables aren't persisting:

1. **Check export command syntax**:
   ```bash
   # Correct
   export VAR=value
   
   # Incorrect (will be intercepted)
   export VAR=value; ls
   ```

2. **Use proper quoting**:
   ```bash
   export VAR="value with spaces"
   ```

## Important Notes

- For remote command execution, SSH key-based authentication must be set up in advance
- For local command execution, commands will run in the context of the user who started the server
- Session timeout is 20 minutes, after which the connection will be automatically closed
- The server automatically handles connection failures and retries with exponential backoff
- All sessions are properly cleaned up on server shutdown
- Working directories and environment variables persist within the same session
- Timeout values must be between 1 and 300 seconds (1000-300000 milliseconds)

## Security Features

This implementation includes comprehensive security measures:

### Command Validation

Dangerous command patterns are automatically detected and blocked:
- `rm -rf /` and similar destructive commands
- Fork bombs like `:(){ :|:& };:`
- Pipe to shell patterns like `curl ... | bash`
- Direct writes to system directories (`/etc/`, `/boot/`)
- Device operations (`dd of=/dev/...`, `mkfs`)

To disable command validation (not recommended):
```bash
ENABLE_COMMAND_VALIDATION=false node build/index.js
```

### Resource Limits

- **Output Size Limit**: Large command outputs are automatically truncated (default 5MB)
- **Session Limit**: Maximum concurrent sessions prevents resource exhaustion (default 10)
- **Session Timeout**: Inactive sessions are automatically cleaned up (default 20 minutes)

### Input Validation

- Session names must be 1-64 alphanumeric characters (with underscores/hyphens)
- Working directories are validated to exist for local commands
- Hostnames and usernames are validated for proper format
- Optional directory whitelist restricts where commands can execute

## Configuration

All limits and timeouts are configurable via environment variables:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `SESSION_TIMEOUT_MS` | 1200000 | Session inactivity timeout in milliseconds (20 min) |
| `MAX_RETRIES` | 3 | Maximum SSH connection retry attempts |
| `CONNECTION_TIMEOUT_MS` | 30000 | SSH connection timeout in milliseconds |
| `MAX_CONCURRENT_SESSIONS` | 10 | Maximum number of concurrent sessions |
| `MAX_OUTPUT_SIZE` | 5242880 | Maximum output size in bytes (5MB) |
| `ENABLE_COMMAND_VALIDATION` | true | Enable dangerous command pattern blocking |
| `COMMAND_BLACKLIST` | (empty) | Comma-separated list of blacklisted command prefixes |
| `ALLOWED_WORKING_DIRECTORIES` | (all) | Comma-separated list of allowed directory prefixes |
| `SSH_KEY_PATH` | ~/.ssh/id_rsa | Path to SSH private key |
| `DEBUG` | false | Enable debug logging |

### Example Configuration

```bash
# Restrictive configuration for production
export MAX_CONCURRENT_SESSIONS=5
export MAX_OUTPUT_SIZE=1048576  # 1MB
export ALLOWED_WORKING_DIRECTORIES="/home/user/projects,/tmp"
export COMMAND_BLACKLIST="shutdown,reboot,poweroff"
node build/index.js

# Permissive configuration for development
export ENABLE_COMMAND_VALIDATION=false
export MAX_OUTPUT_SIZE=52428800  # 50MB
export MAX_CONCURRENT_SESSIONS=50
node build/index.js
```

## Robustness Features

This implementation includes several enterprise-grade robustness features:

- **Automatic Retry Logic**: Failed SSH connections are automatically retried with exponential backoff
- **Connection Health Monitoring**: Active connections are monitored and automatically reconnected when needed
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Proper signal handling ensures all sessions are cleaned up on server termination
- **Input Validation**: All parameters are validated with clear error messages
- **Resource Management**: Sessions are properly managed with automatic cleanup of inactive connections
- **Error Recovery**: The server continues operating even after individual command failures
- **Output Truncation**: Large outputs are safely truncated to prevent memory issues
